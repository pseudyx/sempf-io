If I could summarize what I do in a single sentence, it would be: 

>"I solve complex problems with technology". 

After decades of learning ways to apply my strengths and overcome my difficulties as a neurodivergent (ASD and ADHD) in tech, with seemingly contradicting issues of hyper attention/focus (obsessive) and hyperactive-impulsive attention deficit, building a depth and breadth across diverse technology domains. Sometimes the only way to stop my brain from spinning out of control over multiple threads all at once is to focus it into writing my thoughts on a single thread... This blog is that outlet

I'm passionate about technology and innovation, and have spent 20+ years in my career specialising in distributed and embedded systems design and development... Now days these terms are commonly 'Cloud', 'Hybid' and 'IoT', but I dont forget my roots in IS/IT & OT for on-prem, field and global integrated (wide area and integrated networks) systems.  

I like to apply a technologically agnostic approach to all problems, with my neurodivergent super-powered aptitude for quickly learning and developing new skills and abilities to suit the technological solution for the best result, not limiting the development of the right solution to a pre-defined set of skills or technology.

After years of learning to evolve and adapt, by constantly challenging myself out of my confort-zone, working to disconfirm my beliefs, and seeking diverse and contrasting perspectives to challenge and streangthen my solutions. I have a demonstrated ability at effectively solving complex problems through analysis, experimentation, architecting, developing and managing complex scalable technology solutions.

In my current role at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/) as Next-Gen Tech Lead for the AWS Partner Org (APO) in Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ), I serve as the APOs CTO in APJ, with a focus on what's coming next!

> I care deeply about the future because I am going to spend the rest of my life thereâ€¦ But the future aint what it used to be!
