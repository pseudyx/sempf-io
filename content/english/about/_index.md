If I could summarize what I do in a single sentence, it would be: 

>"I solve complex problems with technology". 

I'm passionate about technology and innovation, and have spent 20+ years in my career specialising in distributed and embedded systems design and development... Now days these terms are commonly 'Cloud', 'Hybid' and 'IoT', but I dont forget my roots in IS/IT & OT for on-prem, field and global integrated (wide area and integrated networks) systems.  

I like to apply a technologically agnostic approach to all problems, with a neurodivergent super-powered aptitude for quickly learning and developing new skills and abilities to suit the technological solution for the best result, not limiting the development of the right solution to a pre-defined set of skills or technology.

While I do beleive in following established practices and patterns, I live my life by the creed:

>1N73LL1G3NC3 15 7H3 4B1L17Y 70 4D4P7 70 CH4NG3 - 573PH3N H4WK1NG

After years of learning to evolve and adapt, by constantly challenging myself out of my confort-zone, working to disconfirm my beliefs, and seeking diverse and contrasting perspectives to challenge and streangthen my solutions. I have a demonstrated ability at effectively solving complex problems through analysis, experimentation, architecting, developing and managing complex scalable technology solutions.

In my current role at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/) as Next-Gen Tech Lead for the AWS Partner Org (APO) in Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ), I serve as the APOs CTO in APJ, with a focus on what's coming next!

Solving the customer problems of today is what we do best as partners. My outlook is on what's coming next and working with our partners to prepare for the future of solving our customers most complex problems of tomorrow.
