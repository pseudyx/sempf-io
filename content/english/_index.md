    content: "For decades I have been technical writing for software documentation, technical whitepapers on practices and patterns, high level and detailed solution designs, and in my tenure at AWS writing like an Amazonian for the development of services, practices and initiatives through PRFAQs, 2 pager and 6 pager narratives... But recently my focus has turned inwards to developing the new generation of tech builders, and building up the tech culture both inside and outside AWS. <br /><br /> That focus has turned into a few initiatives which have led me to teaching and running discussion. One such initiative is a series of internal articles (I have slighly adgusted for an external audience) on Patterns, Practices and Tech the AWS way, written for a level 200 audience. For the more senior technologist, these articles serve as a reminder of what and why we do things the way we do, but for those learning their way into tech, these articles are meant as an aperitive to your development. I hope you get something out of reading them, as I'm having fun writing them, along with a few of my close collegues:"
